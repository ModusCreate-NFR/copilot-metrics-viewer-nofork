What: This pull request addresses two issues related to using mock data in the application and updates the `.gitignore` file.

Why:
1.  **500 Internal Server Errors with Mock Data:** Previously, when `isDataMocked` was enabled, the `/api/seats` and `/api/metrics` endpoints were still attempting to call functions that validate real GitHub API parameters (e.g., `getSeatsApiUrl()`, `getApiUrl()`). This led to "GitHub organization must be set for organization scope" errors, resulting in 500 Internal Server Errors.
2.  **Incorrect Mock Data Path Resolution:** The mock data files were not always correctly resolved in deployed environments due to the use of relative paths with `resolve()`.

How:
1.  **Conditional API Calls:** The logic in `server/api/seats.ts` and `shared/utils/metrics-util.ts` has been refactored. The `apiUrl` assignment and all real data fetching logic are now conditionally executed only when `options.isDataMocked` is `false`. This ensures that when mock data is enabled, the code path for external API calls is completely bypassed.
2.  **Absolute Mock Data Paths:** The mock data file paths in `server/api/seats.ts` and `shared/utils/metrics-util.ts` are now resolved using `resolve(process.cwd(), mockedDataPath)`. This guarantees that the paths are always absolute and correctly resolved from the project's root directory, preventing file not found errors in serverless environments like Vercel.
3.  **Update .gitignore:** The `.gitignore` file has been updated to include `.gemini/tmp/`, ensuring that temporary files generated by the Gemini agent are not tracked by Git.
